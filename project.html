    <h1>Are Conditional Cash Transfers a magic bullet for development?</h1>
    <h2>A Latin America case study</h2>
        <hr>
    <div class="section" id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are payments made to individuals/households dependent on pre-determined investments they make, usually related to human capital formation. They provide immediate poverty alleviation, through transfers, whilst also ensuring longer-term steps are taken to prevent the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In this project, I aim to analyse how CCTs in Latin and Central America have evolved and affected various development indicators.</p>
        <p>The lack of aggregated data on this topic lead me to <a id="text" href="https://dds.cepal.org/bpsnc/cct"> this page</a>. It contains Excel download links to data from each individual CCT programme in the region. I decided to try and automate the process of selecting the variables I was interested in from each file. This ended up being a huge endeavour and a steep learning curve. I first created a beautiful soup to identify the folder names and download them locally. All files contained different variables and years, making it much harder to loop on and select the relevant data. However, I eventually managed to scrape the 4 variables I wanted and save them in a json file. Finally, I wanted to aggregate the variables, namely the budget and people affected, by year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="chart" id="pChart1"></div>
        <p>After the monumental task of obtaining this data, I chose to make a simple chart to show the history of CCTs in the region. After exponential growth from the mid 2000s to 2014, the last few years has seen a decrease in both metrics - a point I will revisit.</p>

        <h2>Poverty</h2>
        <p>I then plotted this trend against the number of people under various international poverty lines, as many national poverty lines in the region are above the absolute poverty line, meaning that metric alone would underestimate poverty. The most reliable source I could find for absolute headcount poverty was ourworldindata. After downloading their huge poverty dataset, I filtered the data in Stata, and then merged it with my aggregated CCT data in Colab. One obstacle encountered was missing values: during certain periods, Chile and Brazil only collected data every other year. There was < 10% of the data missing and I decided that manually computing the averages of the missing values' neighbouring years in excel was the best approach.</p>

        <div class="chart" id="pChart2"></div>
        <p>The first two charts' interactive tooltips were made by pivotting the data and adding a hover function. Although causality cannot be inferred from this chart, it shows a strong trend of poverty reduction over time whilst CCT popularity grows. Interestingly, poverty reduction flattens out once CCTs start shrinking.</p>

        <h2>Inequality</h2>
        <p> After trying to automise the data aggregation by country, I realised that due to missing values the best way would be to manually compute them on excel. For some missing values I computed the average spent/person in the nearest year and used that to impute, and for a few others I used 'Total amount of people in recipient households'. I thought the median would best reflect overall CCT size as some countries had low outliers due to starting up slowly. Gini values are taken from the World Bank API</p>
        <div> <a id="colab" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K8eLnRbQOtmNMhOxdgUaxYnEAFAEKIO7?usp=sharing">Colab Chart 3</a> </div>
        <div class="chart" id="pChart3"></div>
        <p>Whilst all countries that implemented CCT Programmes (excluding Costa RIca, who had a very small % of Population in them) saw a significant reduction in their Giniâ€™s over the given time period, there is no direct correlation between a higher amount of the population being beneficiaries and a bigger reduction in the Gini.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Due to the nature of CCTs and the recency of their popularity, we are yet to discover many of the long-term impacts. To get a glimpse at these, we will now look at how CCTs have affected education, as education is fundamentally the main contributor to building equality of opportunity.</p>
        <p>First, a map showing initial schooling levels in the region, using the World Bank API to call on enrollment data:</p>
        <div class="chart" id="pChart4"></div>
        <p>Secondly, a bivariate map showing terciles of population in CCTs and change in secondary enrolment rates:</p>
        <div class="kepler" id="kep"><iframe src="https://kepler.gl/demo/map?mapUrl=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6d0xrzmpoftlzzj/keplergl_mzk1asi.json" style="border:2px #1844A5 solid;" name="Kepler" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="300px" width="420px" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="palette" id="pChart5"></div>
        <div><a id="colab" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lyeIpSdcUsPvzr8kX8tETLTpuuIUcyHd?usp=sharing">Maps Colab</a></div>
        <p>The bivariate map was made by classifying countries in colab, plotting on Kepler and embedding with an iframe.</p>
        <p>From the maps we see that Argentina and Brazil have low increases in enrolment, but from a much higher base in the 2000s. Overall, we cannot see a strong correlation between our proxy of CCT size and increases in enrolment, however, much like with inequality, a lot of progress has been made since 2000.
