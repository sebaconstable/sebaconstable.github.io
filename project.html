    <h1>Are Conditional Cash Transfers a magic bullet for development?</h1>
    <h2>A Latin & Central America case study</h2>

    <div class="section" id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are payments made to individuals/households dependent on pre-determined investments they make, usually related to human capital formation. They provide immediate poverty alleviation, through transfers, whilst also ensuring longer-term steps are taken to prevent the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In this project, I aim to analyse how CCTs in Latin and Central America have evolved and affected various development indicators.</p>
        <p>The lack of aggregated data on this topic lead me to <a id="text" href="https://dds.cepal.org/bpsnc/cct"> this page</a>. It contains Excel download links to data from each individual CCT programme in the region. I decided to try and automate the process of selecting the variables I was interested in from each file. This ended up being a huge endeavour and a steep learning curve. I first created a beautiful soup to identify the folder names and download them locally. All files contained different variables and years, making it much harder to loop on and select the relevant data. However, I eventually managed to scrape the 4 variables I wanted and save them in a json file. Finally, I wanted to aggregate the variables, namely the budget and people affected, by year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="chart" id="pChart1"></div>
        <p>After the monumental task of obtaining this data, I chose to make a simple chart to show the history of CCTs in the region. After exponential growth from the mid 2000s to 2014, the last few years has seen a decrease in both metrics - a point I will revisit.</p>

        <h2>Poverty</h2>
        <p>I then plotted this trend against the number of people under various international poverty lines, as many national poverty lines in the region are above the absolute poverty line, meaning that metric alone would underestimate poverty. The most reliable source I could find for absolute headcount poverty was ourworldindata. After downloading their huge poverty dataset, I filtered the data in Stata, and then merged it with my aggregated CCT data in Colab. One obstacle encountered was missing values: during certain periods, Chile and Brazil only collected data every other year. There was < 10% of the data missing and I decided that manually computing the averages of the missing values' neighbouring years in excel was the best approach.</p>

        <div class="chart" id="pChart2"></div>
        <p>The first two charts' interactive tooltips were made by pivotting the data and adding a hover function. Although causality cannot be inferred from this chart, it shows a strong trend of poverty reduction over time whilst CCT popularity grows. Interestingly, poverty reduction flattens out once CCTs start shrinking.</p>
